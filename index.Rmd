This is the student consultant handbook for members of Eagle I.O. Herein lie expectations, responsibilities, and strategy to keep Eagle I.O sustailable with future [Montclair State University I/O Psychology](https://www.montclair.edu/psychology/graduate-programs/industrial-organizational-psychology/) cohorts...


# Introduction

+ This is the participation manual for Eagle I.O student consultants. It contains the expectations, roles, and responsibilities of MSU graduate students who are *also* members of Eagle I.O.
+ Members are expected to participate for 1.5 years (one Fall semester, two Spring semesters, and to be reasonably available over Winter and Summer breaks)
+ As of Spring semester 2020, the ongoing projects that Eagle I.O manages include: 
    1) A [mentorship program](https://bookdown.org/kulasj/mentoruser/) between the 1^st^ and 2^nd^ year MSU I.O Masters' program student cohorts, and PhD program student cohorts
    2) An engagement survey
    3) This student consultant manual (which includes, for example, a succession plan to sustain and grow Eagle I.O)
+ Future aspirations are to have Eagle I.O. be a client-facing organization that can provide student-led solutions to external clients
