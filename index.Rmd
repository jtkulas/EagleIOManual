**About us**:

We are a [student-led consulting group](https://eagle-io.weebly.com/) within the Industrial/Organizational Psychology program at [Montclair State University](https://www.montclair.edu/psychology/graduate-programs/industrial-organizational-psychology/), founded in 2019. We look at ourselves as hard-working, driven students who wish to strengthen MSU's I/O Psychology program, as well as learn outside of the classroom to build upon our skills and knowledge.  We pride ourselves with strong involvement in local and national I/O groups, namely [METRO](https://metroapppsych.com/) and [SIOP](https://siop.org).

**Our mission**:

Eagle I.O is established to provide students practical and applied learning experiences to develop skills aligned with their personal and professional goals. The group collaborates to execute a variety of I/O internal and external projects. Eagle I.O strives to prepare students to succeed after integrating into the workforce post-graduation.

**What we do**:

We are responsible for executing various projects. Our main project is developing an Engagement survey, which we wish to distribute to external organizations. We also run a  mentorship program within the MSU I/O program, where we train most of the 2nd year graduate students to guide the new students into becoming successful students themselves. Additionally, we host a variety of events, such as new student orientation,  networking opportunities, and casual hangouts.
