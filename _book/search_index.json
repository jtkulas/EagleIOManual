We look at ourselves as hard-working, driven students who wish to strengthen MSUs I/O Psychology program, as well as learn outside of the classroom to build upon our skills and knowledge. We pride ourselves with strong involvement in local and national I/O groups, namely METRO and SIOP. Our mission: Eagle I.O is established to provide students practical and applied learning experiences to develop skills aligned with their personal and professional goals. The group collaborates to execute a variety of I/O internal and external projects. Eagle I.O strives to prepare students to succeed after integrating into the workforce post-graduation. What we do: We are responsible for executing various projects. Our main project is developing an Engagement survey, which we wish to distribute to external organizations. We also run a mentorship program within the MSU I/O program, where we train most of the 2nd year graduate students to guide the new students into becoming successful students themselves. Additionally, we host a variety of events, such as new student orientation, networking opportunities, and casual hangouts.

Members are furthermore expected to be reasonably available over Winter and Summer breaks. 2.1 Current members need to attend all Eagle I.O meetings (unless there is a legitimate reason for absence), maintain a GPA greater than 3.5, actively participate both within the group and with the products, and lead at least one project within their first 2 semesters of membership. 2.2 New members need to attend all meetings in the latter half of the Spring semester, maintain a GPA greater than 3.5, engage in OCBs, be responsive to professors, and actively contribute to the program culture at MSU. 2.2.1 Opportunity for late admission1 This section outlines the procedure to follow if a student missed the recruitment window, but has indicated an interest to join late Currently, Eagle I.O is limited to a maximum 10 student member cap. If the current occupancy of Eagle I.O is less than 10, then there is a list of minimum requirements to be met prior to being accepted into Eagle I.O: 1 semester of enrollment within the MSU I/O Psychology program 3.8 GPA At least 1 semester remaining in the program An expressed interest 2.3 Eagle I.O expectations (all members) Regardless of whether a new or continuing member, all student consultants are held to the following expectations: Coordinate and attend Fall semester orientation session Attend mandatory bi-weekly meetings during Fall and Spring semesters Stay active and engaged during summer Be a professional ambassador (aligned with: 1) Eagle, 2) MSU, and 3) the larger discipline of I-O Psychology) Attend Eagle I.O events (METRO, social meetings, mentor meetings) Contribute to at least one Eagle I.O project (mentorship program, survey developments) Annually review (and update if warranted) the Mentorship and Consultant manuals Participate as a mentor in the Mentorship program Meet the specific role requirements Successfully execute the responsibilities of the assigned role 2.4 Eagle I.O KSAs (all members) Regardless of whether a new or continuing member, the expectations are that student consultants will be reasonably characterized as: Ability to work in a team-based environment Be receptive to group members opinions and suggestions Take initiative to develop current and future projects Ability to communicate verbally and in writing Critical thinking Self-motivation Being flexible Determination and persistence Ability to organize 2.5 Conflict Eagle I.O members are expected to behave maturely and engage with other members in a respectful and understanding manner. Should arguments and/or disagreements occur regarding decision-making, the faculty advisor has the final say. If continuous conflict originates from a singular member against the rest of the group, that member will be placed on probation for one semester at the discretion of the faculty advisor. Once the member returns from their probation, if they continue to engage in aggressive and/or disrespectful behaviors towards the other members, they will be executed. If there is an interested student who is unable to join due to the group being full (or due to personal time constraints), they are permitted to join any mini-team within Eagle I.O. "],["governance.html", "Chapter 3 Governance 3.1 Meetings 3.2 Consultant development plan 3.3 Structure", " Chapter 3 Governance 3.1 Meetings Regarding time expectations of Eagle I.O members: Meetings are mandatory - there is one excused absence per academic semester (Fall and Spring) If you miss more than one meeting, and cannot call or make other arrangements for your virtual attendence, you will be put on probation (1 semester term) If you miss another meeting while on probation you will be expelled from Eagle I.O and fed to Sir pSyCaDeLiCaT in an agonizingly painful yet exceedingly beautiful ceremony 3.2 Consultant development plan Each consultant, in collaboration with one of the faculty advisors, will complete an individual development plan that is specific to their individualized developmental goals within Eagle I.O. A template plan is available here. Example skills to consider developing within Eagle I.O functions include professional, I/O content-domain specific, and/or technical (R-oriented) skills. The intent is for each student member to meet with a Faculty Advisor in April of their 1st year of Eagle I.O participation to determine at least one personal consultant goal that will be accomplished prior to graduation from the MSU I/O program. Each student is also expected to meet with a Faculty Advisor toward the end of the Fall semester (of their second semester of Eagle I.O participation) to monitor goal progress. 3.3 Structure As of Spring 2021, the formal roles of Eagle I.O are: Faculty roles: Advisor (primary) Advisor (mentorship) Student roles: Governance officer Engagement officer Social media and website coordinator Student mentorship coordinator Alumni mentorship coordinator Event coordinator Parliamentarian R mentor Executive consultant The following chart is somewhat showing off interactive graphs generated by R, but if you hover over a role, you will also get a sense of interdependencies (e.g., estimates of which other roles are most intertwined with the role of focus). Directionality is implied in the figure, although the actual execution of all interactions is intended to be bi-directional. Additional roles can be assigned on an as needed (e.g., project-by-project) basis. The primary responsibilities of these position holders are presented below. Note that role holders are responsible for the accomplishment of their assigned duties, but they are expected to execute tasks within teams (e.g., they are not expected to do all of the work on their own).

Current members may host an information session to inform prospective members of the membership requirements &amp; expectations and the products Eagle I.O currently produces. Under special circumstances (as discussed by all members of Eagle I.O) students may be allowed to join outside the period of recruitment. The decision for membership must be discussed by all current members of Eagle I.O and be unanimous. Criteria Current GPA 3.5 or higher Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCBs) - such as presence at events or hangouts Involvement in the membership program Completed at least 1 semester of classes in the program (Masters or Ph.D.) 5.2 Selection into Formal Roles New members are permitted to nominate themselves and/or others for specific roles. The faculty advisor will consider all nominations and make the final decision for each role. Roles can be assigned to one member, or can be co-owned (this should be determined with the amount of projects/responsibilities the role holds). Role assignments will be discussed after the first-year students have shadowed5 for a semester (shadowing occurs during the Spring semester) 5.3 Resignment and Reassignment Members are allowed to step down at any time. This includes members holding specific titles or roles within Eagle IO. If a member with a title steps down, the role will be reassigned. Reassignment will begin with current members nominating themselves or others for the role. The faculty advisor will then choose the candidate with the most nomination. In the case of a tie or no nominations, the faculty advisor will make the final decision. If a member with a title or role is not fulfilling their responsibilities, the issue will be discussed with the broader Eagle IO group and the faculty advisor. The group will come to a consensus on an appropriate timeline to catch up with their responsibilities. If the member is unable to adhere to and fulfill their responsibilities within the given timeline, the faculty advisor will strip them of their title, and the process to reassign the role will begin. Should the member lapse on their responsibilities again, the issue will be brought to the broader group and a vote will be taken on whether or not to keep the member in their role or strip their title. 5.4 Succession Timetable Timeline Actions Outcomes Deliverables November of 3rd Semester Eagle IO will send out to current first years an invitation to become part of the the group Get an estimate of how many students are interested in joining Eagle IO Email invitation December of 3rd Semester Determine how many first year students are interested in joining Eagle IO Select best candidates based on criteria to join Criteria to join: GPA above 3.5, Applied/academic experience (i.e. internship, research), Attend I/O related event (i.e. Metro, SIOP, Eagle IO events) January of 4th Semester Send out email to people selected to join Eagle IO Finalize how many people will be joining the group Agenda for first meeting with new Eagle IO students February of 4th Semester Have first meeting with new Eagle IO students Onboarding: The purpose of this meeting will be to a) exmplain expectations of members, b) provide guidelines as a member and mentor, and c) get a sense of the roles that are available and what new members are interested in The purpose of the meeting should include presenting current projects to first year students and set dates for future meetings that allow all new members to attend, and plan agenda for next meeting.
