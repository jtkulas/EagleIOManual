This is the student consultant handbook for members of Eagle I.O. Herein lie expectations, responsibilities, and strategy to keep Eagle I.O sustainable with future \href{https://www.montclair.edu/psychology/graduate-programs/industrial-organizational-psychology/}{Montclair State University I/O Psychology} cohorts\ldots{}

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\includegraphics{images/intro.PNG}

\textbf{About us}:

We are a \href{https://eagle-io.weebly.com/}{student-led consulting group} within the Industrial/Organizational Psychology program at \href{https://www.montclair.edu/psychology/graduate-programs/industrial-organizational-psychology/}{Montclair State University}, founded in 2019. We look at ourselves as hard-working, driven students who wish to strengthen MSU's I/O Psychology program, as well as learn outside of the classroom to build upon our skills and knowledge. We pride ourselves with strong involvement in local and national I/O groups, namely \href{https://metroapppsych.com/}{METRO} and \href{https://siop.org}{SIOP}.

\textbf{Our mission}:

Eagle I.O is established to provide students practical and applied learning experiences to develop skills aligned with their personal and professional goals. The group collaborates to execute a variety of I/O internal and external projects. Eagle I.O strives to prepare students to succeed after integrating into the workforce post-graduation.

\textbf{What we do}:

We are responsible for executing various projects. Our main project is developing an Engagement survey, which we wish to distribute to external organizations. We also run a mentorship program within the MSU I/O program, where we train most of the 2nd year graduate students to guide the new students into becoming successful students themselves. Additionally, we host a variety of events, such as new student orientation, networking opportunities, and casual hangouts.

\hypertarget{duties}{%
\chapter{Membership}\label{duties}}

\includegraphics{images/duty.jpg}

All members are expected to participate approximately 8 hours per week, although there is quite a bit of variability around this number depending on current projects. Members are furthermore expected to be reasonably available over Winter and Summer breaks.

\hypertarget{current-members}{%
\section{Current members\ldots{}}\label{current-members}}

\ldots need to attend all Eagle I.O meetings (unless there is a legitimate reason for absence), maintain a GPA greater than 3.5, actively participate both within the group and with the products, and lead at least one project within their first 2 semesters of membership.

\hypertarget{new-members}{%
\section{New members\ldots{}}\label{new-members}}

\hypertarget{late}{%
\subsection[Opportunity for late admission ]{\texorpdfstring{Opportunity for late admission \footnote{If there is an interested student who is unable to join due to the group being ``full'' (or due to personal time constraints), they are permitted to join any mini-team within Eagle I.O.}}{Opportunity for late admission }}\label{late}}

This section outlines the procedure to follow if a student missed the recruitment window, but has indicated an interest to ``join late''

Currently, Eagle I.O is limited to a maximum 10 student member cap.

If the current occupancy of Eagle I.O is less than 10, then there is a list of minimum requirements to be met prior to being accepted into Eagle I.O:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  1 semester of enrollment within the MSU I/O Psychology program
\item
  3.8 GPA
\item
  At least 1 semester remaining in the program
\item
  An expressed interest
\end{itemize}

Under special circumstances (as discussed by all members of Eagle I.O) students may be allowed to join \protect\hyperlink{late}{outside the period of recruitment}. The decision for membership must be discussed by all current members of Eagle I.O and be unanimous.

Criteria

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Current GPA 3.5 or higher
\item
  Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCBs) - such as presence at events or hangouts

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{eagle-i.o-expectations-all-members}{%

\hypertarget{eagle-i.o-ksas-all-members}{%
\section{Eagle I.O KSA's (all members)}\label{eagle-i.o-ksas-all-members}}

Regardless of whether a new or continuing member, the expectations are that student consultants will be reasonably characterized as:

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{conflict}{%
\section{Conflict}\label{conflict}}

Eagle I.O members are expected to behave maturely and engage with other members in a respectful and understanding manner. Should arguments and/or disagreements occur regarding decision-making, the faculty advisor has the final say.

If continuous conflict originates from a singular member against the rest of the group, that member will be placed on probation for one semester at the discretion of the faculty advisor.

Once the member returns from their probation, if they continue to engage in aggressive and/or disrespectful behaviors towards the other members, they will be executed.

\hypertarget{governance}{%
\chapter{Governance}\label{governance}}

\includegraphics{images/governance.png}

\hypertarget{meetings}{%
\section{Meetings}\label{meetings}}

Regarding time expectations of Eagle I.O members:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Meetings are mandatory - there is one excused absence per academic semester (Fall and Spring)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you miss \emph{more than one} meeting, and cannot call or make other arrangements for your virtual attendence, you will be put on probation (1 semester term)
  \item
    If you miss another meeting while on probation you will be expelled from Eagle I.O and fed to \textbf{Sir pSyCaDeLiCaT} in an agonizingly painful yet exceedingly beautiful ceremony
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{consultant-development-plan}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{\href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/13OhBJgO4Lr40uA9s3tLBTm17TNRrQa-NJnfTIbSGmT4/edit?usp=sharing}{Consultant development plan}}{Consultant development plan}}\label{consultant-development-plan}}

Each consultant, in collaboration with one of the faculty advisors, will complete an individual development plan that is specific to their individualized developmental goals within Eagle I.O. A template plan is available \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/13OhBJgO4Lr40uA9s3tLBTm17TNRrQa-NJnfTIbSGmT4/edit?usp=sharing}{here}. Example skills to consider developing within Eagle I.O functions include professional, I/O content-domain specific, and/or technical (\texttt{R}-oriented) skills.

The intent is for each student member to meet with a Faculty Advisor in \emph{April of their 1st year of Eagle I.O participation} to determine at least one personal consultant goal that will be accomplished prior to graduation from the MSU I/O program. Each student is also expected to meet with a Faculty Advisor toward the end of the Fall semester (of their second semester of Eagle I.O participation) to monitor goal progress.

\hypertarget{recruitment}{%
\section{Recruitment}\label{recruitment}}

Current Eagle I.O consultants should send out emails and flyers to current students in the MSU I/O Psychology Program to join Eagle I.O.

Current members may host an information session to inform prospective members of the membership requirements \& expectations and the products Eagle I.O currently produces.

\hypertarget{selection-into-formal-roles}{%
\section{Selection into Formal Roles}\label{selection-into-formal-roles}}

New members are permitted to nominate themselves and/or others for specific roles. The faculty advisor will consider all nominations and make the final decision for each role. Roles can be assigned to one member, or can be co-owned (this should be determined with the amount of projects/responsibilities the role holds). Role assignments will be discussed after the first-year students have shadowed\footnote{Shadowing = attending meetings} for a semester (shadowing occurs during the Spring semester)

\hypertarget{resignment-and-reassignment}{%
\section{Resignment and Reassignment}\label{resignment-and-reassignment}}

Members are allowed to step down at any time. This includes members holding specific titles or roles within Eagle IO. If a member with a title steps down, the role will be reassigned. Reassignment will begin with current members nominating themselves or others for the role. The faculty advisor will then choose the candidate with the most nomination. In the case of a tie or no nominations, the faculty advisor will make the final decision.

If a member with a title or role is not fulfilling their responsibilities, the issue will be discussed with the broader Eagle IO group and the faculty advisor. The group will come to a consensus on an appropriate timeline to catch up with their responsibilities. If the member is unable to adhere to and fulfill their responsibilities within the given timeline, the faculty advisor will strip them of their title, and the process to reassign the role will begin. Should the member lapse on their responsibilities again, the issue will be brought to the broader group and a vote will be taken on whether or not to keep the member in their role or strip their title.
