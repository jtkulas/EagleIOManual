# Progression & Succession

![](images/replacements.PNG)

## Recruitment 

Current Eagle I.O consultants should send out emails and flyers to current students in the MSU I/O Psychology Program to join Eagle I.O.

Current members may host an information session to inform prospective members of the membership requirements & expectations and the products Eagle I.O currently produces. 

## Selection into Formal Roles

New members are permitted to nominate themselves and/or others for specific roles. The faculty advisor will consider all nominations and make the final decision for each role. Roles can be assigned to one member, or can be co-owned (this should be determined with the amount of projects/responsibilities the role holds). Role assignments will be discussed after the first-year students have shadowed[^footie] for a semester (shadowing occurs during the Spring semester)

[^footie]:Shadowing = attending meetings


## Resignment and Reassignment

Members are allowed to step down at any time. This includes members holding specific titles or roles within Eagle IO. If a member with a title steps down, the role will be reassigned. Reassignment will begin with current members nominating themselves or others for the role. The faculty advisor will then choose the candidate with the most nomination. In the case of a tie or no nominations, the faculty advisor will make the final decision.

If a member with a title or role is not fulfilling their responsibilities, the issue will be discussed with the broader Eagle IO group and the faculty advisor. The group will come to a consensus on an appropriate timeline to catch up with their responsibilities. If the member is unable to adhere to and fulfill their responsibilities within the given timeline, the faculty advisor will strip them of their title, and the process to reassign the role will begin. Should the member lapse on their responsibilities again, the issue will be brought to the broader group and a vote will be taken on whether or not to keep the member in their role or strip their title.
