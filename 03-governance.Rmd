## Meetings

Regarding time expectations of Eagle I.O members:  

* Meetings are mandatory - there is one excused absence per academic semester (Fall and Spring)
    + If you miss *more than one* meeting, and cannot call or make other arrangements for your virtual attendence, you will be put on probation (1 semester term) 
    + If you miss another meeting while on probation you will be expelled from Eagle I.O and fed to **Sir pSyCaDeLiCaT** in an agonizingly painful yet exceedingly beautiful ceremony

## [Consultant development plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13OhBJgO4Lr40uA9s3tLBTm17TNRrQa-NJnfTIbSGmT4/edit?usp=sharing) 

Each consultant, in collaboration with one of the faculty advisors, will complete an individual development plan that is specific to their individualized developmental goals within Eagle I.O. A template plan is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13OhBJgO4Lr40uA9s3tLBTm17TNRrQa-NJnfTIbSGmT4/edit?usp=sharing). Example skills to consider developing within Eagle I.O functions include professional, I/O content-domain specific, and/or technical (`R`-oriented) skills.

The intent is for each student member to meet with a Faculty Advisor in *April of their 1st year of Eagle I.O participation* to determine at least one personal consultant goal that will be accomplished prior to graduation from the MSU I/O program. Each student is also expected to meet with a Faculty Advisor toward the end of the Fall semester (of their second semester of Eagle I.O participation) to monitor goal progress.

## Structure {#roles}

```{r Date, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

## created below code so we don't have to manually update year and date

date <- as.character(Sys.Date())
year <- as.numeric(substring(date,1,4))
month <- substring(date,6,7)

month[month == "01"] <- "Winter"
month[month == "02"] <- "Winter"
month[month == "03"] <- "Spring"
month[month == "04"] <- "Spring"
month[month == "05"] <- "Spring"
month[month == "06"] <- "Summer"
month[month == "07"] <- "Summer"
month[month == "08"] <- "Summer"
month[month == "09"] <- "Fall"
month[month == "10"] <- "Fall"
month[month == "11"] <- "Fall"
month[month == "12"] <- "Winter"

```

As of `r month` `r year`, the formal roles of Eagle I.O are:

* Faculty roles:
    + Advisor (primary)
    + Advisor (mentorship)  
    

* Student roles:
    + Governance officer
    + Engagement officer
    + Social media and website coordinator
    + Student mentorship coordinator
    + Alumni mentorship coordinator    
    + Event coordinator
    + Parliamentarian 
    + R mentor
    + Executive consultant

The following chart is somewhat showing off interactive graphs generated by `R`, but if you hover over a role, you will also get a sense of interdependencies (e.g., estimates of which other roles are most intertwined with the role of focus). Directionality is implied in the figure, although the actual execution of all interactions is intended to be bi-directional.

Roles must make use of mini-teams as much as possible to foster more learning opportunities for everyone and distribute responsibilities amongst others. Roles should inform the group of project and mini-team updates, and consistently update Trello and Excel on their project leads.
